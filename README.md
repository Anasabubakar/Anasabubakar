### 👋 Hi, I’m Anas

I’m a **Software Developer** focused on building scalable, user-centered web products with modern JavaScript stacks.

I primarily build with **Next.js, React, and TypeScript**, designing systems that prioritize performance, clarity, and long-term maintainability. I’m especially interested in **AI-powered product features** and how software can solve practical, real-world problems in emerging markets.

I’m also the **Founder of TeenovateX Labs**, where we’re building platforms and communities that help young Africans move from learning to shipping real products.

### 🛠 What I Work With

* **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS
* **Backend & Tools**: Node.js, SQL, Firebase, Git
* **Product & Design**: Figma, design systems, product architecture
* **Exploration**: AI integration, automation, 3D modeling (Solid Edge)

I care deeply about **clean architecture, readability, and maintainability** over chasing trends or tools.
